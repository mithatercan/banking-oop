# Banking-OOP

Inspired by [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O94_yN0-cVI)

I wanted to try the object oriented programming concept with this project.  
A very simple static web application with several functions.

## Getting started

1) Clone this repository.
2) Run the folder on http server.

## Usage

1) You can open a bank account.
2) Login the app with username and password which is created randomly.
3) You can easily withdrawal , deposit and transfer money to accounts.
4) You can change the password of your account.
